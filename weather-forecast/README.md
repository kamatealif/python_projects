# Weather Forecast CLI Tool

The **Weather Forecast CLI Tool** is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to fetch and display weather information for a specific city. It uses caching to minimize repeated API requests and enhance performance.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Information:**  
  Get detailed weather information, including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Pressure
  - Visibility
  - Precipitation

- **Caching Mechanism:**  
  The tool caches weather data locally, reducing redundant API calls for previously queried cities.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Handles cases like:
  - Invalid city names
  - API errors (e.g., network issues or unavailability)

- **Astronomical Information:**  
  Displays sunrise and sunset times for the queried city.

## How It Works

1. **Menu Options:**  
   - `1`: Enter a city name to fetch its weather forecast.
   - `2`: Exit the application.

2. **Weather Data Retrieval:**  
   - If the city data exists in the cache, it is retrieved locally.
   - If not, the tool fetches the data from the `https://wttr.in/{city_name}?format=j1` API and stores it in the cache.

3. **Error Handling:**  
   - Detects invalid inputs (e.g., numbers or special characters in the city name).
   - Displays user-friendly error messages for API failures.

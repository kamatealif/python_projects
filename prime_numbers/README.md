# Prime Number Utilities

A Python-based interactive utility for working with prime numbers. This program allows users to check for prime numbers, find prime factors, generate prime sequences, and explore mathematical properties like twin primes and Goldbach's conjecture.

## Features

- âœ… Check if a number is prime
- âœ… Get the prime factors of a number
- âœ… Get prime factorization in exponential form (e.g., `12 = 2^2 * 3`)
- âœ… Find the next and previous prime numbers
- âœ… List prime numbers in a given range
- âœ… Generate the first `N` prime numbers
- âœ… Check if a number is a twin prime
- âœ… Get Goldbach pairs for even numbers (Goldbach's conjecture)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No installation required! Just download the script and run it with Python.

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kamatealif/python_projects/tree/main/prime_numbers
   cd prime_numbers
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you run the script, you will see a menu with different options. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

### Example Usage
#### Check if a number is prime
```
Enter a number: 19
19 is a prime number.
```

#### Get prime factorization
```
Enter a number: 36
Prime factorization: 2^2 * 3^2
```

#### List prime numbers in a range
```
Enter start of range: 10
Enter end of range: 50
Prime numbers in range 10-50: [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```
